Launched in 2014, MUNCHIES offers groundbreaking content from a youth driven perspective. In today's modern world, the formerly tangible pleasures of music, film, and emerging media are just one click away. Food and the events that manifest around it are one of the everlasting experiences that cannot be replicated by arcs and zeroes. MUNCHIES chronicles the wide spectrum of the global culinary experience and the diverse voices that are pulling us forward: chefs and home cooks, makers and consumers, the politics and policies of food, \"front\" and \"back of house\" restaurant life, old wives tales and innovative news, and culturally significant indicators in our modern world. Through engaging original video content, compelling editorial features, articles, how-tos, recipes and events, MUNCHIES offers a signature perspective on the intersection where humans and food connect.",
